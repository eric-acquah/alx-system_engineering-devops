The load-balancer uses the predictive load balancing algorithm which is
a combination of the fastest and observed load-balancing algorithms. It
works by determining in real-time which server in the cluster has the best
performance and response speed to direct the incoming traffic to.

The load balancer in my structure is using the Active-Passive setup.
The Active-Passive setup involves handeling all incoming load with one
server and reserving the other server as a failover in case of an overload.
Active-Active on the other hand requires two or more active servers to evenly
distribute incoming traffic.

Primary-replica cluster database architecture involves the setup of a primary
database, handeling all the read-write operations and one or more replica databases
serving mainly read operations, these replica databases also often serve as failover
measures.

The main differance is the primary node handles all read-write operations whiles
the replica node serves read operations only.

Single-Point-Of-Failure in this structure is the load balancer. When the load-
balancer is down, incoming traffic can not be properly distributed, which may
cause one or both of the servers to fail if QPS increases.

This setup is not secure because all kinds of traffic are given unrestricted access
to the servers which poses as a major security treat.

The lack of a monitoring system in this setup is also another draw back as it will
be difficult to measure QPS among other factors, which may cause upredictable
occurances in the system without anyone knowing, this may eventually bring about
total system failure.
