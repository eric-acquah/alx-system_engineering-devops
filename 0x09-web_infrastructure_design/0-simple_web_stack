A server is a piece of computer hardware or software that is set up to respond
to the request of other devices known as clients.

The domain name makes it easy to access a website without knowing
the IP address of the server it is hosted on.

Cname record

The websever primarily receives HTTP request and serve the necessary web content
based on the given request to the client which sent the request.

The application server handels the business logic necessary to proccess a given
data.

The database is used to store and manage the data of the website.

HTTP protocol

The Single Point Of Failure in this strurcture is the websever. If the websever
is down, request from client will have no response.

The downtime in the case of an update to the system could extend to days
if not weeks, since there is no high availabilty system put in place to ensure
a short lived downtime.

This system cannot scale if there is a higher incoming traffic because there is
only one websever handeling the workload.
